<div class="titre">Add exercices to roadmap</div>
<div>
  Required: to add exercices, you have to be signed in and to have a roadmap opened (
  see <aide value="roadmap/creation">create a roadmap</aide> or <aide value="roadmap/load">open a roadmap<aide>).
</div>
<div>
  When a roadmap is opened, you can see the <focus value="a#btn_exercice_create">“New Exercice” button</focus>.
</div>
<div>
  If this button is visible, you can <strong>click on it to initiate a new exercice</strong>. A form opens where you can define the characteristics of the exercice.
</div>
<div class="bold">
  Note the first button, at the top of the form. When you click on it, you reach the Exercices Data Base of “Music Roadmap”. You just have to choose exercices in this database to add them to your roadmap.
</div>
<div class="italic">
  (this database grows up day after day, so don't hesitate to submit a request to Phil for a new exercice, via <focus value="a#mail_to_phil">the contact button</focus>. This exercice will be added in priority.)
</div>
<div>
  If you want to know how to add exercices from the database, see <aide value="exercice/add_from_db.html">Add an exercice from the Exercices Data Base</aide>. Otherwise, if you want to add an exercice of yours, read the following.
</div>
<!-- Description des champs du formulaire -->
<div class="soustitre">Field descriptions</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <focus value="exercice_recueil">“Collection” field</focus> defines the book title from which the exercice or the study is extracted (p.e. “Study op. 25”). You can omit this value.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <focus value="exercice_titre">“Title” field</focus> contains… the title of the exercice, which just can be “n°12” if its collection is defined. This title is required.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <focus value="exercice_auteur">“Author” field</focus> defines the author of the exercice (e.g. “Chopin”).
  </li>
  <li>
    Under these three general fields you find two checkboxes:<ul>
      <li>The <focus value="span#span_obligatory">“Obligatory” checkbox</focus> lets you define that this exercice must always be worked, when you ask Music Roadmap to prepare a work session for you.</li>
      <li>The <focus value="span#span_with_next">“Linked to next” checkbox</focus> lets you specify that this exercice must be link to the next exercice. That means that if you play the exercices without stopping, Music Roadmap will share to total working time between all exercices linked (yes, Music Roadmap records your working time)</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Under these checkboxes you can define the difficulties of the exercice. Open the difficulty list with the <focus value="a#btn_toggle_types_exercices">“modify…” button</focus> then check every difficulty the exercice focuses on.
    <br>
    <i>Note that this definition is very important if you want Music Roadmap to show you usefull reports. Thanks to the difficulties definition, Music Roadmap can tell you the working time on each difficulty for the day or a period of time (by default: the current month). So you can know exactly how much time you focused on each difficulty.</i> 
  </li>
  <li>
    The “Tempi” row contains three pop-up. You can define:
    <ul>
      <li>The <focus value="select#exercice_tempo">current tempo for the exercice</focus>;</li>
      <li>The <focus value="select#exercice_tempo_min">slowest tempo</focus> (e.g., in the “Hanon”, min tempo of the first exercice should be set to 60);</li>
      <li>The <focus value="select#exercice_tempo_max">fastest tempo</focus> (e.g., in the “Hanon”, max tempo of the first exercice should be set to 108).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The <focus value="select#exercice_tone">“Tone” pop-up</focus> lets you define the tone of the exercice, if any. Note that if this tone is not defined, so it is an “harmonic”  exercice for Music Roadmap, and a new tone will be provided at each new work session.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <focus value="exercice_suite">“Suite” pop-up</focus> lets you define the “Harmonic Suite” of the exercice. Click on the "?" which appears when you move your mouse over the pop-up to have more details.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <focus value="input#exercice_nb_mesures">“Measure number”</focus> lets you define the measure count for the exercice. This data is usefull to prepare work session for a fixed time. <strong>Count ALL the measures</strong>, i.e. with repetitions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then define the <focus value="input#exercice_nb_temps">“Number of beats per measure”</focus>.
    <br>
    <i>Note that Music Roadmap can calculated the duration of the exercice according to the last three information. Set them with care.
    <br> 
    But Music Roadmap is smart, so it also uses your real working time on the exercice. That means that the more you work with Music Roadmap, the more precise is the calcul of the tailored work session.</i> 
  </li>
  <li>
    You can add an image (excerpt of the score) with the <focus value="exercice_image">Image field</focus>. <strong>This image is not settable yet</strong>, but you can send your images to Phil to add them to your roadmap.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, you can add a note with the <focus value="textarea#exercice_note">“Note” field</focus>. Maybe a recommandation of you professor. You can update this field as soon as it's necessary, with the “edit” button of the exercice (in the exercice listing).
  </li>
  <li>
    Nothing right new about the “Import” row. You have to have several roadmaps to use it.
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  You can now create the exercice clicking the Il ne vous reste plus qu'à créer l'exercice en cliquant sur <focus value="btn_exercice_save">“Save this new exercice” button</focus>.
</div>
<div>Congratulations!</div>
<div>
